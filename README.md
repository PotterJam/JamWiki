# JamWiki
JamWiki was created to be a place to dump knowledge, and make it fast to find again. You can create 'wikis', give them tags, and search for them.

I'm moving the domains over to https://jampot.wiki, coming soon.

# Building
To run the production build (currently tailored to my production env, will need some changes):
- Start nginx with the file in the root
- Run the productionBuild.sh script
